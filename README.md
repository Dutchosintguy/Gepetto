# Gepetto
Generate new identities using thispersondoesnotexist.com and a face recognition AI

## how to use

Simple ! First install the faker and requests libraries
```pip3 install requests faker```.
Now just run 
```python gepetto.py```
and generate new identities.

## how does it work ?

_TLDR_ : Uses [thispersondoesnotexist](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com) to generate a face then use a face recognition API to generate coherent identities 
I'll soon write a blog post [here](https://yarienkiva.ml/whatever_this_article_is_called) to document the thought process and steps I've taken to code this project.
